- Pushed changes (commit: 62b2eea)

### 2. Fixed GitHub CI Tests

## ‚ùå Pending Tasks

### 1. CRITICAL: Set GEMINI_API_KEY in Render
**This requires manual action in Render dashboard**
- See [SET_GEMINI_KEY_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./SET_GEMINI_KEY_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Without this, worker cannot process jobs

### 2. Worker Not Processing Jobs
- 9 jobs stuck in "pending" status
- Worker waiting for GEMINI_API_KEY

### 3. No Opportunities Extracted Yet
- Cannot test tenders.gov.au scraping until worker is running
- Frontend shows 0 opportunities

## üìä Current System State

### Services Status
- **API**: ‚úÖ Running at https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Running at https://hoistscout-frontend.onrender.com  
- **Worker**: ‚ùå Not processing (needs GEMINI_API_KEY)
- **Database**: ‚úÖ Connected and operational

### Jobs Status
- Total Jobs: 9
- Pending: 9
- Running: 0
- Completed: 0

### Test Website
- Site: Australian Tenders (tenders.gov.au/atm)
- Status: Added to system
- Jobs Created: 6
- Results: None yet

## üéØ Next Actions Required

1. **You must manually set GEMINI_API_KEY in Render** (see instructions)
2. Monitor worker logs after restart
3. Run `python3 check_worker_status.py` to verify processing
4. Run `python3 test_tenders_scraping.py` to test actual extraction
5. Compare results with tenders.gov.au page 4, first opportunity

## üöÄ Once Worker is Running

The system will:
1. Process all 9 pending jobs
2. Use Gemini AI to extract tender opportunities
3. Store results in database
4. Display opportunities in frontend

Expected timeline:
- API key set ‚Üí 1-2 min for service restart
- Jobs start processing ‚Üí Within 30 seconds
- First results ‚Üí 1-2 minutes per job

## GitHub CI Status
- Should now pass with the test fixes
