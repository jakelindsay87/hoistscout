## Technical Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Worker Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   docker logs hoistscraper-worker
   
   # Verify database connection
   docker exec hoistscraper-worker python -c "from hoistscraper.db import engine; print('DB OK')"
   
   # Check for pending jobs
   docker exec hoistscraper-backend python -c "from hoistscraper.models import ScrapeJob; from sqlmodel import Session, select; from hoistscraper.db import engine; print(len(Session(engine).exec(select(ScrapeJob).where(ScrapeJob.status == 'pending')).all()), 'pending jobs')"
   ```

2. **Ollama Extraction Fails**
   ```bash
   # Check if model is loaded
   docker exec hoistscraper-ollama ollama list
   
   # Pull model if missing
   docker exec hoistscraper-ollama ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct
   ```

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check PostgreSQL logs
   docker logs hoistscraper-db
   
   # Verify migrations
   docker exec hoistscraper-backend python -m hoistscraper.db
   ```

### Performance Tuning

- **Concurrent Scraping**: Adjust `MAX_CONCURRENT_SCRAPES` in worker config
- **Rate Limiting**: Configure `RATE_LIMIT_DELAY` per site requirements
- **Memory Usage**: Ollama requires ~4GB RAM for 7B model
- **Database Connections**: Set `POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS` for scale
