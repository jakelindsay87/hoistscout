## Issue Summary

The worker container is deployed and marked as "live" on Render, but it's not processing any jobs. All 17 jobs in the queue are stuck in "pending" status, with the oldest being from earlier today.

### Possible Causes
1. **Redis Connection Issues**: Worker may not be able to connect to Redis
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Worker may not be able to connect to PostgreSQL
3. **Celery Configuration**: Worker may not be listening to the correct queues
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect environment variables
5. **Container Health**: Container may be running but worker process crashed

### Next Steps
1. Access Render Dashboard to view worker logs: https://dashboard.render.com/worker/srv-d1hlvanfte5s73ad476g
2. Check the worker's stdout/stderr for error messages
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set
4. Check if the debug startup script is producing output
5. Consider SSH into the worker container if Render allows it
