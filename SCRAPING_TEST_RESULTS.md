# HoistScout Scraping Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-08

### üéØ Objective
Test scraping of https://www.tenders.gov.au/atm (page 4, first opportunity) and compare with actual data.

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Google Gemini Integration**
   - Successfully integrated Google Gemini API as LLM backend
   - Added configuration: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `USE_GEMINI=true`, `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash`
   - Updated ScrapeGraphAI to use Gemini instead of Ollama
   - Deployed configuration to Render services

2. **GitHub CI Fixes**
   - Fixed Poetry installation error by adding `backend/README.md`
   - Fixed ESLint configuration by adding `frontend/.eslintrc.json`
   - Pushed fixes to GitHub (commit: 1f6b95a)

3. **API Deployment**
   - API is healthy and running at https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com
   - Authentication working with demo credentials
   - All endpoints accessible

### ‚ùå Issues Identified

1. **Worker Not Processing Jobs**
   - All scraping jobs remain in "pending" status
   - Worker service appears to be deployed but not processing the job queue
   - 9 jobs created, none have been processed
   - No opportunities have been extracted yet

2. **Tenders.gov.au Access**
   - The website has security measures blocking automated access (403 errors)
   - Manual browser access required to view actual tender data
   - Cannot programmatically verify extraction accuracy without worker processing

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The worker service is likely experiencing one of these issues:
1. **Redis Connection**: Worker may not be connecting to Redis queue
2. **Environment Variables**: Gemini API key may not be properly set in worker
3. **Deployment Issue**: Worker may have failed to start after recent deployment
4. **Import Errors**: ScrapeGraphAI or dependencies may be missing

### üìã Next Steps Required

1. **Check Worker Logs**
   ```bash
   # In Render dashboard, check hoistscout-worker logs for errors
   ```

2. **Verify Worker Environment**
   - Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set
   - Ensure `USE_GEMINI=true` is set
   - Check Redis connection string

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Set environment variables
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyA3G2UHBuIMB26yR9yU3dhuoXs0lT6t_nA"
   export USE_GEMINI=true
   # Run worker
   celery -A app.worker worker --loglevel=info
   ```

4. **Manual Verification Process**
   Since automated access to tenders.gov.au is blocked:
   - Visit https://www.tenders.gov.au/atm
   - Navigate to page 4
   - Note the first tender's details:
     - Title
     - Reference Number (ATM####)
     - Closing Date/Time
     - Agency
     - Category
     - Description

### üö® Critical Finding

**The worker is not processing any jobs**, which means:
- No actual web scraping is happening
- Gemini integration cannot be tested in production
- All jobs remain in pending state indefinitely

### üìà Test Metrics

- **Jobs Created**: 9
- **Jobs Processed**: 0
- **Opportunities Extracted**: 0
- **Success Rate**: 0%
- **Worker Status**: Not Processing

## üé¨ Conclusion

While the infrastructure is deployed and the API is functional, the core scraping functionality is not working due to the worker not processing jobs. This needs to be resolved before we can:
1. Test Gemini extraction accuracy
2. Compare extracted data with actual tenders
3. Validate the end-to-end scraping pipeline

The GitHub CI issues have been partially resolved with the missing file fixes, but the worker deployment issue is blocking the primary functionality test.
