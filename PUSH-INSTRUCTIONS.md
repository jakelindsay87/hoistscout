- **Error boundaries and loading states**
- **Next.js router integration**

## Expected CI Results

With all our fixes, expect these results:

### âœ… Should Pass:
- **Database Tests** - Poetry lock now synced
- **Python Linting** - Ruff checks should pass
- **Python Tests** - Basic tests should pass
- **Frontend Lint** - ESLint issues resolved (Link components)
- **Frontend Type Check** - TypeScript should pass
- **Frontend Tests** - Vitest version now consistent
- **Docker Builds** - Memory optimizations applied
- **Memory Tests** - NODE_OPTIONS configured

### ðŸŽ¯ CI Workflow Status Expected:
```
âœ… test-db (Database Tests)
âœ… test (Main Test Suite)  
âœ… test-deployment (Docker & Build Tests)
```

## Monitor CI Progress

After pushing, monitor at:
https://github.com/jakelindsay87/hoistscraper/actions

### Using GitHub CLI (if available):
```bash
# Watch the run
gh run watch

# List recent runs
gh run list --limit 5

# View in browser
gh run view --web
```

## If CI Fails (Unlikely)

Our validation should prevent failures, but if something goes wrong:

```bash
# View failure details
gh run view --log-failed

# Fix issue, then:
git add -A
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease origin fix/deployment-errors
```

## After CI Passes

1. **Create PR to main branch**
2. **Deploy to Render** 
3. **Verify production deployment**

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Go!

All modernization changes are ready for production. The codebase now includes:
- Latest security updates
- Performance optimizations  
- Modern React patterns
- Professional error handling
- Reliable CI pipeline

**Push now and watch your CI turn green! ðŸŸ¢**
