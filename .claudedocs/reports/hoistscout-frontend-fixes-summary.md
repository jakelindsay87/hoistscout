# HoistScout Frontend Deployment Fixes Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-02  
**Test Duration**: ~1 hour  
**Status**: Fixes Applied, Awaiting Full Deployment

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Frontend Dockerfile Missing API URL Configuration ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Root `Dockerfile.hoistscout-frontend` was missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` configuration
- **Fix**: Added ARG and ENV directives in both builder and runner stages
- **Commit**: 8f1804b

### 2. API URL Configuration in Frontend Code ✅ FIXED  
- **Issue**: Frontend `lib/api.ts` had wrong base URL (included `/api` suffix)
- **Fix**: Removed `/api` suffix and updated all endpoints to include `/api` prefix
- **Commit**: c505b2d

### 3. Hardcoded Production API URL ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Main frontend had hardcoded `https://hoistscraper.onrender.com` for all Render deployments
- **Fix**: Added hostname detection to route hoistscout deployments to `https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com`
- **Commit**: d108140

### 4. Next.js Configuration ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Missing next.config.js file
- **Fix**: Created next.config.js with proper environment variable handling
- **Commit**: c505b2d

### 5. Worker Module Import Error ✅ FIXED (Previous Session)
- **Issue**: Worker couldn't find `app.worker` module
- **Fix**: Added PYTHONPATH environment variable to Dockerfile and render.yaml
- **Commit**: 735feb3

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- Backend API: `https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com/api/health` returns healthy
- Worker module imports fixed with PYTHONPATH configuration

### Pending Deployment ⏳
- Frontend changes pushed but not yet live
- Render deployments typically take 5-10 minutes
- Frontend still showing old cached build

## Architecture Clarification

The deployment uses two different frontend codebases:
1. **Main Frontend** (`/frontend`): HoistScraper - Full featured UI
2. **HoistScout Frontend** (`/hoistscout/frontend`): Minimal setup

The deployed frontend at `hoistscout-frontend.onrender.com` is using the main frontend codebase, which explains the "HoistScraper" branding.

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables Set
```yaml
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com
```

### Build Command
```bash
docker build --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com -f ./frontend/Dockerfile .
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Deployment**: Allow 5-10 more minutes for Render to complete the build and deployment
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Test with hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or incognito mode
3. **Verify API Calls**: Check browser DevTools Network tab to confirm correct API URL
4. **Test All Pages**: Verify Dashboard, Sites, Opportunities, Jobs pages load data

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Frontend loads without "Failed to connect" error
- [ ] Dashboard shows statistics
- [ ] Sites page loads site list
- [ ] Opportunities page displays data
- [ ] Jobs page shows job queue
- [ ] Create new site functionality works
- [ ] Scraping can be triggered

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check Render deployment logs for build errors
2. Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Check browser console for API URL being used
4. Confirm CORS settings allow frontend domain

## Deployment Timeline

- 04:43 UTC: Worker fixes pushed
- 05:05 UTC: Frontend API configuration fixes pushed  
- 05:15 UTC: Hardcoded API URL fix pushed
- 05:25 UTC: Awaiting deployment completion

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been fixed in code. The deployment is in progress on Render. The frontend should be fully functional once the deployment completes and the new build is served. The main issue was the hardcoded API URL that didn't account for the hoistscout-specific deployment.
