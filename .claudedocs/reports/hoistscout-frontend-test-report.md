# HoistScout Frontend E2E Test Report

**Date**: 2025-07-02  
**Test URL**: https://hoistscout-frontend.onrender.com/  
**Tester**: Claude Code with Puppeteer

## Executive Summary

The HoistScout frontend is deployed but completely non-functional due to API connectivity issues. All pages fail to load data and display error messages.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. API Connection Failure (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Frontend cannot connect to the backend API
- **Error Message**: "Failed to connect to the API. Please check your connection and try again."
- **Root Cause**: Frontend is calling `http://localhost:8000/api` instead of the production API URL
- **Impact**: 100% - No functionality works without API connection

### 2. Environment Variable Not Set
- **Issue**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not being properly injected during build
- **Code Location**: `/lib/api.ts:4`
- **Current Behavior**: Falls back to `http://localhost:8000/api`
- **Expected**: Should use `https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com`

### 3. All Pages Show Errors
- **Dashboard**: "Unable to load dashboard"
- **Sites Page**: "Failed to load sites" with Retry button
- **Opportunities Page**: Same error pattern
- **Jobs Page**: Not tested but likely same issue
- **Analytics Page**: Not tested but likely same issue

### 4. UI/UX Issues
- **Large Logo**: The HoistScout logo takes up significant screen space
- **Error Handling**: Error messages are shown but retry functionality doesn't fix the underlying issue
- **Loading States**: No proper loading indicators

## Technical Analysis

### Frontend Configuration (`/lib/api.ts`)
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000/api';
```

This configuration requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to be set at build time for Next.js applications.

### Render.yaml Configuration
The frontend service has the environment variable configured:
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
    value: https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com
```

However, the build command uses a build argument:
```yaml
buildCommand: docker build --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com -f ./frontend/Dockerfile .
```

### Suspected Issue
The Dockerfile may not be properly handling the build argument and passing it to the Next.js build process.

## Screenshots Captured

1. **Homepage** - Shows sidebar with navigation but main content shows API connection error
2. **Opportunities Page** - Same layout with API error
3. **Sites Page** - Shows "Failed to load sites" with Retry button

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required

1. **Fix Frontend Dockerfile**
   - Ensure `ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is properly set before `npm run build`
   - Verify the environment variable is available during the Next.js build phase

2. **Add Health Check Endpoint**
   - Frontend should have a health check that verifies API connectivity
   - This would help identify deployment issues faster

3. **Improve Error Messages**
   - Show the actual API URL being attempted
   - Add more diagnostic information in error states

4. **Add Fallback Configuration**
   - Consider adding a runtime configuration option
   - Allow API URL to be configured post-deployment

### Code Changes Needed

1. **Update Dockerfile** to properly handle the build argument:
   ```dockerfile
   ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   RUN npm run build
   ```

2. **Add Debug Information** to error messages:
   ```typescript
   console.error(`API call failed. Using base URL: ${API_BASE_URL}`);
   ```

3. **Consider Runtime Configuration**:
   - Use Next.js publicRuntimeConfig for post-build configuration
   - Or implement a configuration endpoint

## Test Execution Details

- **Test Framework**: Puppeteer with headless Chrome
- **Test Duration**: ~5 minutes
- **Pages Tested**: 3 (Dashboard, Opportunities, Sites)
- **Interactions Tested**: Page navigation, Retry button click
- **Network Monitoring**: Attempted but limited by browser security

## Conclusion

The HoistScout frontend deployment is currently non-functional due to a misconfiguration of the API URL. The issue appears to be in the build process where the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable is not being properly injected into the Next.js build. This is a deployment configuration issue rather than a code issue.

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Application is completely unusable
**Priority**: P0 - Must be fixed immediately
**Estimated Fix Time**: 30 minutes with proper Dockerfile updates
