## ❌ Failed Service:

**API** (srv-d1hltovfte5s73ad16tg): ❌ FAILED
- Build: Successful
- Deploy: Failed during startup
- Last error: Still investigating runtime issue

## Summary of Fixes Applied:

### Successful Fixes:
1. ✅ Pushed all code from local to GitHub repository
2. ✅ Fixed all missing UI components (dialog, select, label, input, use-toast)
3. ✅ Resolved all Python package version conflicts
4. ✅ Fixed WebsiteCredential import errors  
5. ✅ Set required environment variables (CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE, DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL)
6. ✅ Added missing dependencies (prometheus-client, sentry-sdk)
7. ✅ Fixed worker scrapegraphai dependency resolution issues

### Remaining Issue:
The API service builds successfully but fails during runtime startup. This could be due to:
- Database connection issues
- Port binding problems  
- Other runtime configuration issues

## Cost-Saving Recommendations:

To avoid further deployment costs while debugging the API:
1. **Local Testing**: Use the provided `test_imports.py` script to verify dependencies
2. **Docker Testing**: Test the Dockerfile locally before pushing:
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile.hoistscout-api -t test-api .
   docker run -p 10000:10000 test-api
   ```
3. **Suspend Services**: Consider suspending the API service until the issue is resolved

## Next Steps:

The API failure appears to be a runtime issue rather than a dependency problem. To debug:
1. Check Render logs for the specific runtime error
2. Verify database is accessible from the API service
3. Check if port 10000 is properly configured
4. Consider adding a health check endpoint that doesn't require database
