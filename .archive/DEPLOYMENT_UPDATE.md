   - Modified Dockerfile to handle dependency conflicts
   - Installing langchain dependencies separately to avoid timeout

4. **Static Site (srv-d1hlrhjuibrs73fen260)**: ‚úÖ LIVE
   - Successfully deployed
   - Accessible at: https://hoistscout-info.onrender.com

## Fixes Applied:
1. ‚úÖ Fixed missing UI components (dialog, select, label, input, use-toast)
2. ‚úÖ Fixed WebsiteCredential import errors
3. ‚úÖ Created models_credentials.py with proper field names
4. ‚úÖ Added WebsiteCredentialRead model
5. ‚úÖ Set required environment variables via API
6. ‚úÖ Updated worker Dockerfile to handle scrapegraphai dependencies
7. ‚úÖ Fixed all Python package version conflicts

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for worker build to complete
2. Check API deployment logs for the specific startup error
3. The API is likely failing due to:
   - Missing database tables (needs migration)
   - Redis connection issues
   - Port binding issues

## Recommendations:
- Once worker build completes, we should check if it deploys successfully
- For the API, we may need to:
  - Add database migration on startup
  - Verify Redis service is running
  - Check if port 10000 is properly configured
