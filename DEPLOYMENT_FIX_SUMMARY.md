# HoistScout Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The HoistScout services on Render.com were stuck during the build process with Poetry hanging on "Resolving dependencies..." due to complex dependency conflicts in the original pyproject.toml.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Replaced with the proper workflow from https://github.com/Veraticus/nix-config/tree/main/home-manager/claude-code
- Now follows Research → Plan → Implement workflow
- Includes proper validation checkpoints

### 2. Fixed Makefile
Added required commands per CLAUDE.md:
- `make fmt` - Formats code with black and ruff
- `make test` - Runs all tests
- `make lint` - Runs linting checks

### 3. Simplified Dependencies
Removed problematic packages that caused Poetry to hang:
- scrapegraphai (AI scraping - optional)
- unstructured (document processing)
- pytesseract (OCR)
- pypdf2, pdf2image (PDF processing)
- python-anticaptcha (captcha solving)
- undetected-chromedriver (stealth browser)

### 4. Updated Configuration
- Changed Python version from ^3.11 to ^3.8 for compatibility
- Updated Dockerfile to use simplified dependencies
- Successfully generated poetry.lock file

## Files Modified
- `/backend/pyproject.toml` - Simplified dependencies
- `/backend/Dockerfile` - Updated to use new dependencies
- `/backend/poetry.lock` - Generated successfully
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with proper workflow
- `/Makefile` - Added fmt, test, lint commands

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: Resolve deployment issues with simplified dependencies"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment on Render:**
   - API: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1hltovfte5s73ad16tg
   - Frontend: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1hlum6r433s73avdn6g
   - Worker: https://dashboard.render.com/worker/srv-d1hlvanfte5s73ad476g

4. **Access deployed services:**
   - API: https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com
   - Frontend: https://hoistscout-frontend.onrender.com

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify services are running:**
   - Check API health endpoint: https://hoistscout-api.onrender.com/api/health
   - Access frontend: https://hoistscout-frontend.onrender.com
   - Monitor worker logs in Render dashboard

2. **Re-add advanced features gradually:**
   Once the base deployment is stable, you can gradually add back:
   - AI-powered scraping (scrapegraphai)
   - Advanced PDF processing
   - OCR capabilities
   - Anti-detection browser features

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   In Render dashboard, ensure these are set:
   - GEMINI_API_KEY (if using AI features)
   - Any SMTP credentials for notifications
   - Other service-specific keys

## Validation Checklist
- [x] Poetry resolves dependencies successfully
- [x] poetry.lock file generated
- [x] Makefile has required commands (fmt, test, lint)
- [x] CLAUDE.md follows proper workflow
- [x] Dockerfile updated with working configuration
- [ ] Services deployed and running on Render
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Frontend accessible

## Notes
- The simplified deployment removes some advanced features temporarily
- Core functionality (scraping, job management, API) remains intact
- This approach ensures a stable base deployment first
- Advanced features can be added incrementally once confirmed working
