# Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. JWT Authentication Issue (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: JWT verification was failing with "Subject must be a string" error
**Root Cause**: The python-jose library requires the JWT 'sub' field to be a string, but we were passing integer user IDs
**Fix**: Modified `/root/hoistscout-repo/backend/app/utils/auth.py` to:
- Convert user IDs to strings when creating tokens
- Convert back to integers when verifying tokens
**Result**: User can now log in successfully

### 2. Blank Dashboard Issue (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: After successful login, the dashboard/sites page was blank
**Root Cause**: FastAPI was redirecting `/api/websites` to `/api/websites/` (307 redirect), causing issues with the frontend fetch
**Fix**: Updated frontend API calls in `/root/hoistscout-repo/frontend/src/hooks/useSites.ts` to:
- Use `/api/websites/` (with trailing slash) instead of `/api/websites`
- Updated both the GET and POST endpoints
- Also updated test mocks to match
**Result**: API calls now work correctly without redirects

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **File**: `backend/app/utils/auth.py`
   - Modified `create_access_token()` and `create_refresh_token()` to convert integer user IDs to strings
   - Modified `verify_token()` to convert string user IDs back to integers

### Frontend Changes
1. **File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useSites.ts`
   - Changed `/api/websites` to `/api/websites/` in the `useSites()` hook
   - Changed `/api/websites` to `/api/websites/` in the `useCreateSite()` hook

2. **File**: `frontend/src/test/mocks/handlers.ts`
   - Updated mock handlers to use `/api/websites/` to match production

## Verification

Created test scripts to verify the fixes:
1. `test_websites_endpoint.py` - Identified the 307 redirect issue
2. `test_fixed_websites.py` - Verified the fix works with trailing slash
3. `test_frontend_api.html` - Simple HTML page to test frontend API calls

All endpoints now work correctly:
- ✅ `/api/auth/login` - User can authenticate
- ✅ `/api/auth/me` - Returns current user info
- ✅ `/api/websites/` - Returns list of websites (empty array initially)

## Next Steps

The user should now be able to:
1. Log in successfully ✅
2. See the dashboard without blank screens ✅
3. Add and manage websites through the UI

If there are any remaining issues, they would likely be related to:
- Specific UI components not rendering
- Additional API endpoints that need trailing slash fixes
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates (if used)
