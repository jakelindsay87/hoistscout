# HoistScraper Production Alignment Report

## 🎯 Current PRD vs Implementation Status

### Core Product Vision (from UI_REQUIREMENTS.md)
**Purpose**: Internal admin dashboard for managing Australian grant/funding opportunity scraping from 244 pre-configured sites.

### Critical Requirements Status

#### 1. **Opportunities Page** ❌ MISSING - HIGH PRIORITY
**PRD Requirement**: Display all scraped grant opportunities with filtering, sorting, and export
**Current State**: 
- ✅ Backend API exists (`/api/opportunities`)
- ✅ Database model implemented
- ❌ Frontend page completely missing
- ❌ Export functionality not implemented

#### 2. **Jobs Page** ❌ MISSING - HIGH PRIORITY  
**PRD Requirement**: Monitor scraping jobs, trigger new jobs, view logs
**Current State**:
- ✅ Backend API exists (`/api/scrape-jobs`)
- ✅ Manual trigger endpoint added (`/api/scrape/{id}/trigger`)
- ❌ Frontend page missing
- ❌ Job logs not accessible via API

#### 3. **Enhanced Dashboard** ⚠️ PARTIAL
**PRD Requirement**: Statistics, activity feed, quick actions
**Current State**:
- ✅ Stats API endpoint exists (`/api/stats`)
- ⚠️ Basic dashboard exists but missing key features
- ❌ Activity feed not implemented
- ❌ Quick actions incomplete

#### 4. **Sites Page** ✅ WORKING
**PRD Requirement**: Basic CRUD for websites
**Current State**: Fully functional

#### 5. **Extraction Pipeline** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (but not deployed)
**Implicit Requirement**: Extract structured data from HTML
**Current State**:
- ✅ Ollama integration created
- ✅ Enhanced worker (worker_v2.py) built
- ❌ Not actively running due to Redis issues

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Architectural Issues**
- **Redis/Worker Broken**: Jobs created but not processed automatically
- **Missing CLI Directory**: Import path broken in main.py
- **Frontend Dependencies**: Missing @heroicons/react package

### 2. **Security Vulnerabilities** 
- **Hardcoded Encryption Key**: credential_manager.py line 33
- **No Authentication**: All endpoints publicly accessible
- **No Rate Limiting**: DoS vulnerability
- **SQL Injection Risk**: No URL validation

### 3. **Quality Issues**
- **Zero Test Coverage**: No backend tests exist
- **No Input Validation**: Accepts any data format
- **Generic Error Handling**: Hides real issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Worker cleanup issues

## 📋 Tasks Remaining for Production

### Week 1: Critical Fixes (Must Have)
1. **Fix Worker/Queue System** (2 days)
   - Fix Redis connection issues OR
   - Replace with simpler job system (Celery/Background Tasks)
   
2. **Build Opportunities Page** (3 days)
   - Create React component with data table
   - Add filtering and sorting
   - Implement CSV/JSON export
   
3. **Build Jobs Page** (2 days)
   - Job status monitoring UI
   - Manual trigger interface
   - Basic log viewer

### Week 2: Security & Stability (Should Have)
1. **Add Authentication** (2 days)
   - Basic auth middleware
   - Protect all endpoints
   
2. **Input Validation** (2 days)
   - URL format validation
   - Field length limits
   - SQL injection prevention
   
3. **Fix Security Issues** (1 day)
   - Remove hardcoded encryption salt
   - Add rate limiting
   - Restrict CORS

### Week 3: Quality & Testing (Should Have)
1. **Add Test Suite** (3 days)
   - Unit tests for API endpoints
   - Integration tests for scraping
   - Test credential encryption
   
2. **Error Handling** (2 days)
   - Specific exception types
   - Proper logging
   - User-friendly error messages

### Week 4: Production Hardening (Nice to Have)
1. **Monitoring** (2 days)
   - Add Sentry error tracking
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Health check endpoints
   
2. **Performance** (2 days)
   - Add pagination
   - Fix N+1 queries
   - Add caching
   
3. **Documentation** (1 day)
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guide
   - User manual

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Breaking Issues (Do Today)
```bash
# Fix missing CLI directory
mkdir -p backend/cli
mv backend/import_csv.py backend/cli/

# Fix frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Fix Python version in pyproject.toml
# Change: python = "^3.9" to python = "^3.8"
```

### 2. Get Worker Running (Do Tomorrow)
Either:
- Fix Redis connection issues in docker-compose.yml
- OR implement simpler background job system

### 3. Build Missing UI (This Week)
Priority order:
1. Opportunities page (core value)
2. Jobs page (operational necessity)
3. Enhanced dashboard (nice to have)

## 📊 Effort Estimation

| Component | Status | Effort | Priority |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Opportunities UI | Missing | 3 days | CRITICAL |
| Jobs UI | Missing | 2 days | HIGH |
| Worker Fix | Broken | 2 days | CRITICAL |
| Security | Vulnerable | 3 days | HIGH |
| Testing | None | 3 days | MEDIUM |
| Monitoring | None | 2 days | LOW |

**Total**: ~15 days of focused development

## ✅ Validation Checklist

Before going to production, ensure:

- [ ] Worker processes jobs automatically
- [ ] Opportunities page shows scraped data
- [ ] Jobs page allows monitoring
- [ ] Authentication protects all endpoints
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 1s response)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Security scan passed

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The system is production-ready when:
1. Users can view scraped opportunities in the UI
2. Scraping jobs run automatically and reliably
3. System is secure with authentication
4. Errors are tracked and logged
5. Performance meets requirements
6. Documentation enables self-service

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Today**: Fix breaking issues (CLI path, dependencies)
2. **Tomorrow**: Get worker running or implement alternative
3. **This Week**: Build opportunities and jobs pages
4. **Next Week**: Security hardening and testing
5. **Week 3**: Production deployment

The system has good bones but needs the core UI and stability fixes to deliver value to users.
