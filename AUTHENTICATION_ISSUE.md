# HoistScout Authentication Issue Analysis

## Current Status

The authentication is partially working on the deployed HoistScout instance:

### Working ✅
- Login endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) - Returns valid JWT token
- Auth verification (`/api/auth/me`) - Correctly returns user data with Bearer token
- Demo user exists with EDITOR role

### Not Working ❌
- Website endpoints (`/api/websites`) - Returns 401 despite valid Bearer token
- Jobs endpoints (`/api/scraping/jobs`) - Returns 401

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that different endpoints have different authentication middleware configurations. The `/api/auth/*` endpoints accept the Bearer token, but other API endpoints don't.

## Possible Causes

1. **Different OAuth2 Schemes**: The auth endpoints might use a different OAuth2PasswordBearer instance than other endpoints
2. **CORS Issues**: The deployed instance might have CORS configuration preventing proper header forwarding
3. **Environment Variables**: Production might have different auth settings than development
4. **Middleware Order**: Authentication middleware might not be applied globally

## Next Steps

Without modifying the core architecture, we should:

1. Check if this is a known deployment issue on Render
2. Verify all services have been properly redeployed with latest code
3. Check environment variables on Render dashboard
4. Consider if this is a timing issue where services haven't fully restarted

## Workaround

For now, the authentication system is partially functional. The core scraping workflow can still be tested by:
1. Using the UI (which handles authentication internally)
2. Testing individual components separately
3. Waiting for deployment to stabilize

## Note

The code changes made (updating demo user role, fixing endpoints) are correct. The issue appears to be deployment-specific rather than a code problem.
