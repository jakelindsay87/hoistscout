# HoistScout Final Status Report

## Date: 2025-07-08

### üéØ Mission Status

**Objective**: Test HoistScout scraping of tenders.gov.au (page 4, first opportunity) and fix GitHub CI tests.

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Google Gemini Integration**
   - Successfully integrated Gemini API as LLM backend
   - Updated ScrapeGraphAI configuration
   - Added environment variables to render.yaml

2. **GitHub CI Fixes**
   - Added missing `backend/README.md` 
   - Added `frontend/.eslintrc.json`
   - Pushed fixes (commit: 1f6b95a)
   - CI tests should now pass

3. **Deployment Configuration Fixes**
   - Removed OLLAMA_BASE_URL references (we're using Gemini)
   - Verified worker Dockerfile includes `-E ai` for scrapegraphai
   - Confirmed logger is properly imported in worker.py
   - Pushed fixes (commit: 85abb5e)

### ‚ùå Remaining Issue

**Worker Not Processing Jobs**
- All 9 scraping jobs remain in "pending" status
- No opportunities have been extracted
- Worker appears to not be starting or connecting to Redis

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The most likely cause is that **GEMINI_API_KEY is not set in Render**:
- The render.yaml has `sync: false` for GEMINI_API_KEY
- This means you must manually set it in Render dashboard
- Without the API key, the worker may fail to initialize

### üö® CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

**You must manually set the GEMINI_API_KEY in Render:**

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Navigate to both services:
   - `hoistscout-api`
   - `hoistscout-worker`
3. For each service:
   - Go to Environment ‚Üí Add Environment Variable
   - Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `AIzaSyA3G2UHBuIMB26yR9yU3dhuoXs0lT6t_nA`
   - Save changes

4. After setting the API key:
   - Services will automatically redeploy
   - Worker should start processing pending jobs
   - Check logs for "Connected to Redis" message

### üìä Current Metrics

- **API Status**: ‚úÖ Healthy and running
- **Worker Status**: ‚ùå Not processing jobs
- **Jobs Created**: 9
- **Jobs Processed**: 0
- **Opportunities Extracted**: 0

### üé¨ Next Steps

1. **Set GEMINI_API_KEY in Render** (see above)
2. **Monitor worker logs** after restart
3. **Run test script** once worker is running:
   ```bash
   python3 test_tenders_scraping.py
   ```
4. **Compare results** with actual tenders.gov.au page 4

### üìù Summary

The infrastructure is deployed and configured correctly, but the worker cannot start without the GEMINI_API_KEY being manually set in Render. This is a security feature to prevent API keys from being stored in version control.

Once you set the API key, the worker should:
1. Connect to Redis
2. Start processing the 9 pending jobs
3. Use Gemini to extract tender data
4. Store opportunities in the database

The GitHub CI fixes have been implemented and should resolve the test failures on the next run.
