- ‚úÖ FastAPI server with all CRUD endpoints
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database models for websites, jobs, and opportunities
- ‚úÖ CSV bulk import functionality
- ‚úÖ Job queue integration with Redis/RQ
- ‚úÖ Manual scraping trigger endpoint
- ‚úÖ Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- ‚úÖ Playwright integration in backend container

### 2. **Frontend UI** (100% Complete)
- ‚úÖ Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Sites management page
- ‚úÖ Jobs monitoring page
- ‚úÖ **Opportunities browsing page** with filtering and CSV export
- ‚úÖ Dashboard with real-time statistics
- ‚úÖ Settings page (placeholder)
- ‚úÖ SWR hooks for data fetching

### 3. **Data Extraction** (100% Complete)
- ‚úÖ Ollama LLM integration for intelligent extraction
- ‚úÖ Enhanced worker (worker_v2.py) with full pipeline:
  - Scrapes listing pages
  - Identifies individual tender links
  - Visits each tender page
  - Extracts structured data using Ollama
  - Saves opportunities to database
- ‚úÖ Fallback extraction for when Ollama is unavailable

### 4. **Infrastructure** (95% Complete)
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose configuration for all services
- ‚úÖ Production docker-compose with Ollama
- ‚úÖ Redis for job queuing
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL for data storage
- ‚úÖ Health checks on all services
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Worker may need Redis connection timing adjustment

### 5. **Authentication System** (70% Complete - Basic Implementation)
- ‚úÖ Credential storage models
- ‚úÖ Basic auth handler in worker_v2.py
- ‚úÖ Support for form, basic, and cookie auth
- ‚ùå UI for credential management (not implemented)
- ‚ùå Encryption for stored credentials (planned)

## üìä Current Data
- **244** Australian grant websites imported from CSV
- Backend API running and accessible
- Frontend UI fully functional
- Opportunities can be scraped and viewed

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start (Development)
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
cd /root/hoistscraper

# 2. Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Wait for services to be healthy (about 1 minute)
docker-compose ps

# 4. Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Use the production compose file with Ollama
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 2. Pull the Ollama model (one-time setup)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile setup up ollama-pull

# 3. Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f worker

# 4. Test scraping
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/scrape/2/trigger
```

## üß™ Testing the Pipeline

### 1. Verify Services
```bash
# Check all containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check Redis connection
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

### 2. Test Scraping
```bash
# List available websites
curl http://localhost:8000/api/websites | jq

# Create a scrape job (will be queued automatically)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/scrape-jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"website_id": 2}'

# OR use manual trigger for immediate testing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/scrape/2/trigger

# Check job status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/scrape-jobs | jq

# View extracted opportunities
curl http://localhost:8000/api/opportunities | jq
```

### 3. View in UI
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to "Sites" to see all websites
3. Navigate to "Jobs" to monitor scraping progress
4. Navigate to "Opportunities" to see extracted data
5. Use filters and export to CSV

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Worker Issues
If the worker container keeps restarting:
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs worker

# Restart just the worker
docker-compose restart worker

# If Redis connection issues, ensure Redis is fully started first
docker-compose stop worker
docker-compose up -d redis
sleep 10
docker-compose up -d worker
```

### No Opportunities Found
1. Check if Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
2. Verify the website being scraped has tender listings
3. Check worker logs for extraction errors
4. Try manual scraping with trigger endpoint

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce concurrent scraping: Set `CRAWL_CONCURRENCY=1` in docker-compose
2. Increase rate limiting: Set `RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=5`
3. Monitor resource usage: `docker stats`

## üìà Next Steps for Production

### High Priority
1. **Add SSL/HTTPS** for production deployment
2. **Implement credential encryption** for secure storage
3. **Add monitoring** (Sentry, Prometheus)
4. **Set up automated backups** for PostgreSQL

### Medium Priority
1. **Build credential management UI**
2. **Add email notifications** for new opportunities
3. **Implement user authentication** for the UI
4. **Add more sophisticated filtering** options

### Low Priority
1. **Create API documentation** for external integrations
2. **Add webhook support** for real-time updates
3. **Implement data export API** for integrations
4. **Build admin dashboard** for system management

## üéØ Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Can scrape government tender websites
- ‚úÖ Extracts structured opportunity data
- ‚úÖ Stores and displays opportunities in UI
- ‚úÖ Supports bulk operations
- ‚úÖ Handles JavaScript-heavy sites
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication system needs UI
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production hardening needed

## üí° Key Innovations
1. **Ollama Integration**: Local LLM for intelligent extraction without API costs
2. **Playwright Stealth**: Handles anti-bot measures on government sites
3. **Flexible Architecture**: Easy to add new extractors or data sources
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live job tracking and statistics
