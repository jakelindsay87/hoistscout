# HoistScraper Production Summary

## What I've Done

### 1. Architecture Review ✅
- Identified that Redis/RQ queue system exists but jobs aren't being enqueued
- Found that Ollama was removed and "LLM extractor" is just BeautifulSoup
- Discovered missing UI for opportunities (backend exists, frontend missing)
- Worker container has Playwright but keeps restarting due to Redis issues

### 2. Documentation Cleanup ✅
- Created `PRODUCTION_PLAN.md` with complete architecture overview
- Created `QUICK_FIXES.md` for immediate solutions
- Created `docker-compose.prod.yml` with Ollama integration
- All docs now accurately reflect current state and path forward

### 3. Code Improvements ✅
- Added job enqueueing to `create_scrape_job` endpoint
- Added manual trigger endpoint `/api/scrape/{website_id}/trigger`
- Created `ollama_extractor.py` for intelligent data extraction
- Created `worker_v2.py` with full extraction pipeline

### 4. Files Created/Modified
```
NEW:
- /root/hoistscraper/PRODUCTION_PLAN.md
- /root/hoistscraper/QUICK_FIXES.md
- /root/hoistscraper/docker-compose.prod.yml
- /root/hoistscraper/backend/hoistscraper/extractor/ollama_extractor.py
- /root/hoistscraper/backend/hoistscraper/worker_v2.py

MODIFIED:
- /root/hoistscraper/backend/hoistscraper/main.py (added job enqueueing and trigger endpoint)
- /root/hoistscraper/docker-compose.yml (fixed worker target)
```

## Current State

### ✅ Working
- PostgreSQL database with models
- Backend API with all endpoints
- 244 Australian grant sites in database
- Manual trigger endpoint (needs Playwright in backend for now)

### ❌ Not Working
- Automatic job execution (worker Redis issues)
- Opportunity extraction (no Ollama, basic extractor insufficient)
- Frontend opportunities page (API exists, UI missing)
- Authentication for protected sites

## Immediate Next Steps (To Get Demo Working)

### 1. Quick Fix Option (30 minutes)
Add Playwright to backend for immediate testing:
```dockerfile
# In backend/Dockerfile after line 32:
RUN poetry run playwright install chromium --with-deps
```
Then: `docker-compose build backend && docker-compose up -d backend`

### 2. Start Ollama Service (1 hour)
```bash
# Use the production compose file
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d ollama ollama-pull
```

### 3. Test Full Pipeline
```bash
# Trigger a scrape
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/scrape/2/trigger

# Check opportunities
curl http://localhost:8000/api/opportunities
```

## Production Deployment Steps

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Deploy with `docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. Fix Redis connection in worker (or replace with Celery)
3. Implement `worker_v2.py` as main worker
4. Add Ollama model pulling to deployment

### Week 2: Missing Features
1. Build `/opportunities` page in frontend
2. Implement credential storage for auth sites
3. Add pagination handling for tender listings
4. Implement job monitoring UI

### Week 3: Production Hardening
1. Add Sentry error tracking
2. Implement rate limiting properly
3. Add CloudFlare protection
4. Set up backup strategy

### Week 4: Scaling
1. Add horizontal scaling for workers
2. Implement caching layer
3. Add monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
4. Load testing and optimization

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Why Ollama?
- Local LLM = no API costs
- Privacy compliant (data stays local)  
- Good at structured extraction
- Can be fine-tuned for Australian government terminology

### Why Keep Playwright?
- Handles JavaScript-heavy government sites
- Built-in anti-detection features
- Supports authenticated sessions
- Already implemented and working

### Why PostgreSQL + Redis?
- PostgreSQL for persistent data (opportunities, sites, jobs)
- Redis for job queuing (or replace with RabbitMQ/Celery)
- Both are production-proven technologies

## Critical Missing Pieces

### 1. Extraction Pipeline
The current worker just saves HTML. Need to:
- Parse listing pages for individual tender URLs
- Scrape each tender detail page
- Extract structured data with Ollama
- Save as Opportunity records

### 2. Frontend UI
Backend API exists but no way to view data:
- `/opportunities` page (table with filters)
- `/jobs` page (monitor scraping progress)
- Enhanced dashboard with real stats

### 3. Authentication System
For sites requiring login:
- Credential storage (encrypted)
- Login flow in Playwright
- Session management

## Recommended Architecture

```
User → Frontend → Backend API → PostgreSQL
                      ↓
                 Job Queue (Redis/Celery)
                      ↓
                 Worker Pool
                   ↙    ↘
            Playwright   Ollama
                ↓          ↓
            Raw HTML → Structured Data → Database
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Can scrape tenders.gov.au listing page
- ✅ Can extract individual tender URLs
- ✅ Can scrape tender detail pages
- ✅ Can extract structured data (title, deadline, amount, etc.)
- ✅ Can view opportunities in UI
- ✅ Can monitor job progress
- ✅ Can handle authenticated sites

This analysis was performed on 2025-06-27. The codebase shows good foundation but needs the extraction pipeline completed and UI built to be production-ready. The main value proposition (viewing scraped opportunities) is currently not accessible to users.
