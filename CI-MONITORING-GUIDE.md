## If Something Fails 🚨

**Unlikely, but if it happens:**

1. **Check the logs**:
   ```bash
   gh run view --log-failed
   ```

2. **Fix and re-push**:
   ```bash
   # Make fix
   git add -A
   git commit --amend --no-edit
   git push --force-with-lease origin fix/deployment-errors
   ```

3. **Get help**: Share the error message

## Success Indicators 🟢

Look for:
- ✅ **All jobs green**
- ✅ **No red X marks**
- ✅ **"All checks have passed"**
